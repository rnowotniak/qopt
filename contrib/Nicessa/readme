What is this?
--------------------
Nicessa runs stochastic simulations.

You write the actual simulation, but nicessa relieves you of:
- arranging runs for all combinations of your dependent variables
- distributing workload on different machines
- generating nice paper-ready plots and T-Tests from the results

There are example simulations in the "example" folder and you can find extensive documentation at
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~nicolas/nicessa/
(If you have sphinx, you can also generate the documentation yourself by going
 into that directory and typing 'make html').

Dependencies
--------------------
You need Python 2.7, or 2.6 if you install the argparse module locally (remote
hosts that execute your code can also run lower versions, say 2.3+).
You need the python-paramiko library for remote server support.
For plotting, you need gnuplot and epstopdf (some tips: for debian-linux, epstopdf 
is currently in the "texlive-extra-utils" package. On OSX, install gwTex via i-installer).
For T-Tests, you need Gnu R installed.


Running a simulation
--------------------
Place an experiment configuration and your simulation code in a folder of your choice (see basic example).
Call ./experiment.py <path-to-your-experiment-folder>
The results will be put in the "data" directory, in your folder 
(but if you like the plotting capabilities of nicessa you might never look there).


Enjoy.
